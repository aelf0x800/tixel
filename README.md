# tixel
A header only library for graphics in the terminal

# NOTE
* This library is best paired with stb.
* Use a performant terminal emulator such as Alacritty or Kitty for the best performance.

# TODO
- [x] Shape functions
- [X] Add support for varying components per pixel with tixel_draw_buffer
- [X] Event handling
- [ ] Event handling for mice (maybe?)
